# Health Insurance Costs: A Statistical Investigation in R

## Introduction
Healthcare costs in the United States are a major public concern, with insurance premiums varying significantly across demographics. One controversial factor in determining premiums is gender. Historically, women have often faced higher insurance premiums, with the justification that they visit hospitals more frequently. However, this raises an important question: Do women actually incur higher medical costs than men?

In this project, we analyze a dataset containing medical costs of American individuals billed by health insurance companies. Our goal is to determine whether men or women, on average, require higher reimbursements from insurers. If men, in fact, incur higher healthcare costs, then the gender-based pricing disparity in premiums may not be justified.

## Research Question
We investigate whether gender should be a factor in setting health insurance premiums by exploring which gender requires more reimbursement from insurance companies. Our preliminary analysis reveals that:

- The mean charge for men is $13,956.75
- The mean charge for women is $12,569.58
This suggests that men, on average, require more reimbursement than women, contradicting the common practice of higher premiums for women.

## Methodology 
To ensure our conclusions are data-driven, we apply statistical inference techniques, particularly hypothesis testing, using R. We define our hypotheses as follows:

- Null Hypothesis (H0): Women incur as much, if not more, medical costs than men.
- Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Men incur higher medical costs than women.
We conduct a hypothesis test at a 5% significance level, a commonly accepted threshold in statistical analysis.

## Tools & Approach
This project is implemented in R, utilizing statistical tests to evaluate the hypothesis and determine whether gender-based premium pricing is justified. The findings contribute to the ongoing discussion on fairness in health insurance policies.

## About  
This project was completed as part of **STAT 201 (Elementary Statistics)**. It investigates whether gender should influence health insurance premiums by analyzing medical cost data and conducting hypothesis testing in R. Using statistical inference methods, the project explores if men or women incur higher healthcare costs on average.
